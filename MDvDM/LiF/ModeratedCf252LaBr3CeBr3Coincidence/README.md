# ModeratedCf252LaBr3CeBr3Coincidence — Full Coincidence Detection Setup

The complete experiment setup: Cf-252 Watt-spectrum neutrons pass through a polyethylene moderator (30 cm x 30 cm x 8 cm), then through a lead collimator (9 cm thick, 1 cm diameter hole), into a LiF crystal (1 cm³, Li-7), with LaBr3(Ce) (1.5" cylinder) and CeBr3 (1" cylinder) scintillation detectors recording coincidence events.

## What it studies
Neutron-gamma discrimination using time-correlated coincidence detection across multiple scintillator types.

## Physics
Watt fission spectrum source, QGSP_BIC_AllHP hadronics, EM standard (option 4), radioactive decay.

## Output
ROOT ntuples with energy and timing in both LaBr3 and CeBr3 detectors. Analysis produces coincidence plots, energy spectra comparisons, and timing distributions.
