# Post-OSU — Thermal Neutron Activation in CZT

Fires thermal neutrons (0.025 eV) at a CZT (Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride) crystal (~19 cm³) and records total energy deposited per event.

## What it studies
Identifying which peaks in the CZT energy spectrum are due to **internal activation** — i.e., nuclear reactions and de-excitations within the CZT material itself caused by thermal neutron capture.

## Physics
High-precision hadron elastic and inelastic physics (QGSP_BIC_AllHP), EM standard (option 4), and radioactive decay.

## Output
ROOT ntuple with energy deposition per event (keV). Runs across 32 threads.
