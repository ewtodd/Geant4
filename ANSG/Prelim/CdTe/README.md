# CdTe — Gamma Response of Cadmium Telluride Detector

Simulates the response of a CdTe detector (2.82 mm radius, 1 mm thick, modeled after a Mirion Technologies detector) to ~68.75 keV gamma rays produced by thermal neutron activation of germanium.

## How it works
Gamma positions and momenta are read from `optimized.root` (generated by the GeometryOptimizationHPGe subproject). The gamma energy is sampled from a Gaussian around 68.75 keV with CdTe-appropriate resolution.

## Physics
EM standard (option 4) with Auger and fluorescence.

## Output
ROOT ntuple with energy deposited per event.
